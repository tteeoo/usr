# dotfiles

My Arch (now technically Artix) Linux configuration files.

Mainly for backup/archival purposes, but you can use them if you want.

See [sainnhe/gruvbox-material-gtk](https://github.com/sainnhe/gruvbox-material-gtk) for my gtk themes.

See [tteeoo/suckless](https://github.com/tteeoo/suckless) for my window manager and terminal.
